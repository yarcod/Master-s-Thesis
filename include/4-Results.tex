\chapter{Results}
In this chapter, we measure application performance in different systems. First, we use the reference system to establish the benchmark applications' characteristics. Next, we run simulations, configured to emulate the behaviour of different memory technologies, where we first set a performance baseline with DRAM and then measure HMC, HBM, WIO performance. Finally, we summarise the results.

\section{Simulation}
Now that the benchmark applications have been evaluated, we would like to see what performance impact we get from running them again but with different memory types. This should, in turn, mean that these two applications probably will see the largest respectively the lowest gain in performance from faster memories. Therefore, the following simulations only include these two benchmarks. 

\section{Summary}
Summarise the results without actually discussing the implications; leave that for the next part!
