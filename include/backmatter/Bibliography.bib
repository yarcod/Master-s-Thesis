	abstract = {The quest for novel low-dissipation devices is one of the most critical for the future of semiconductor technology and nano-systems. The development of a low-power, universal memory will enable a new paradigm of non-volatile computation. Here we consider STT-RAM as one of the emerging candidates for low-power non-volatile memory. We show different configurations for STT memory and demonstrate strategies to optimize key performance parameters such as switching current and energy. The energy and scaling limits of STT-RAM are discussed, leading us to argue that alternative writing mechanisms may be required to achieve ultralow power dissipation, a necessary condition for direct integration with CMOS at the gate level for non-volatile logic purposes. As an example, we discuss the use of the giant spin Hall effect as a possible alternative to induce magnetization reversal in magnetic tunnel junctions using pure spin currents. Further, we concentrate on magnetoelectric effects, where electric fields are used instead of spin-polarized currents to manipulate the nanomagnets, as another candidate solution to address the challenges of energy efficiency and density. The possibility of an electric-field-controlled magnetoelectric RAM as a promising candidate for ultralow-power non-volatile memory is discussed in the light of experimental data demonstrating voltage-induced switching of the magnetization and reorientation of the magnetic easy axis by electric fields in nanomagnets.}

abstract = "A challenge in computer architecture is that processors often cannot be fed data from DRAM as fast as CPUs can consume it. Therefore, many applications are memory-bandwidth bound. With this motivation and the realization that traditional architectures (with all DRAM reachable only via bus) are insufficient to feed groups of modern processing units, vendors have introduced a variety of non-DDR 3D memory technologies (Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC),Wide I/O 2, High Bandwidth Memory (HBM)). These offer higher bandwidth and lower power by stacking DRAM chips on the processor or nearby on a silicon interposer. We will call these solutions “near-memory,” and if user-addressable, “scratchpad.” High-performance systems on the market now offer two levels of main memory: near-memory on package and traditional DRAM further away. In the near term we expect the latencies near-memory and DRAM to be similar. Thus, it is natural to think of near-memory as another module on the DRAM level of the memory hierarchy. Vendors are expected to offer modes in which the near memory is used as cache, but we believe that this will be inefficient. In this paper, we explore the design space for a user-controlled multi-level main memory. Our work identifies situations in which rewriting application kernels can provide significant performance gains when using near-memory. We present algorithms designed for two-level main memory, using divide-and-conquer to partition computations and streaming to exploit data locality. We consider algorithms for the fundamental application of sorting and for the data analysis kernel k-means. Our algorithms asymptotically reduce memory-block transfers under certain architectural parameter settings. We use and extend Sandia National Laboratories’ SST simulation capability to demonstrate the relationship between increased bandwidth and improved algorithmic performance. Memory access counts from simulations corroborate predicted performance improvements for our sorting algorithm. In contrast, the k-means algorithm is generally CPU bound and does not improve when using near-memory except under extreme conditions. These conditions require large instances that rule out SST simulation, but we demonstrate improvements by running on a customized machine with high and low bandwidth memory. These case studies in co-design serve as positive and cautionary templates, respectively, for the major task of optimizing the computational kernels of many fundamental applications for two-level main memory systems."

abstract="The evolution of main memories, from SDR to the current DDR, presents multiple technological breakthroughs, but still far from the requirements of the processors. With the advent of Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC), a promise of high bandwidth with low energy consumption and less area may provide better efficiency than the traditional DDR modules. This is especially attractive for embedded systems. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive performance comparison between HMC and DDR memories, to understand the capabilities and limitations of both. Simulation results running SPEC-CPU2006 and SPEC-OMP2001 benchmarks show that applications with low memory pressure behave similarly with HMC or DDR. We make the new observation that HMC performs better than DDR specially for applications with a high memory pressure and low spatial data locality. However, for applications with a streaming behavior, commonly present in the embedded system domain, our experiments show that current HMC row-buffer specifications do not take advantage of the spatial locality present in those applications.",

It integrates various power and thermal modeling tools and computes run-time energy dissipation for core, network on chip, memory controller and shared cache. It also provides functionality to update the leakage power as temperature changes. We illustrate the utilization of the framework by applying it to explore interconnect options in manycore systems with consideration of temperature variation and leakage feedback. We compare power, energy-delay-area product (EDAP) and energy-delay product (EDP) of four manycore configurations-1 core, 2 cores, 4 cores and 8 cores per cluster. Results from simulation with or without consideration of temperature variation both show that the 4-core per cluster configuration has the best EDAP and EDP. Even so, considering that temperature variation increases total power dissipation, we demonstrate the importance of considering temperature variation in the design flow. With this power, area and thermal modeling capability, the SST can be used for hardware/software co-design of future exascale systems.}",
