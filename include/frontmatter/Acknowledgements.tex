\section*{Acknowledgements}
Miquel Pericas and Dmitry Knyaginin helped us believe that finishing the thesis was not unfeasible, and their assistance throughout this slow process has been invaluable. John Leidel has been an amazing help along the way to get the memory simulator running the way we needed, an unfaltering supporter of the work. The SST community has also been very helpful along the way. Thank you!
